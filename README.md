# SteamLinkerBot
A Discord bot made in Python that takes a link with a steam header, passes it through the API of Temporary-URL.com, and returns a button that contains the link, allowing the user to click and join a lobby without having to copy paste to their browser.

You need a Temporary URL premium account in order to get the keys to use their API. Their API also only allows 30 API calls a minute and 5000 API calls a day, which the code accounts for.
